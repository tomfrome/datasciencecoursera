## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## The first function, makeCacheMatrix, creates a special "matrix", which is really a list containing a function to 1. set the value of the matrix 2. get the value of the matrix 3. set the inverse of the matrix 4. get the inverse of the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
	inv <- NULL
	set <- function(y) {
		x <<- y
		inv <<- NULL
	}
	get <- function() x
	setinv <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
	getinv <- function() inv
	list(set = set, get = get, setinv = setinv, getinv = getinv) 
}

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix" created with the above function. However, it first checks to see if the inverse has already been calculated. If so, it gets the inverse from the cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of the matrix and sets the inverse in the cache via the setinv function.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
	inv <- x$getinv()
	if(!is.null(inv)) {
		message("getting cached data")
		return(inv)
	}
	data <- x$get()
	inv <- solve(data, ...)
	x$setinv(inv)
	inv
}

## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
